    <h3>Global Warming</h3>
    <div class="content">
        <p>Climate change is factor in which the temperature of the Earth changes. Global warming is a type of climate
            change that the temperature of Earth increases. Like; in 2000 the temperature of night in Islamabad, in the
            month of April was 20o Celsius, while now it is about 22oC. This sort of climate change is called Global
            Warming. It happens because of Carbon Dioxide (CO2). It is a gas which is produced when any hydrocarbon,
            mostly referred as fuel is burnt. This includes burning of oil, gas, coal, wood or any other fossil fuel.
            Most of them are used by industries and motor vehicles. The Carbon Dioxide which is produced by industries
            and motor vehicles, are mixed with the atmosphere and makes a layer in the atmosphere. Before this layer was
            formed, most of the rays which are emitted from the sun were reflected back into space. This used to
            maintain the temperature of Earth. Now the layer allows the rays but do not let them out. This rises the
            temperature of Earth.</p>

        <p>This sort of effect is called Green House Effect. Another reason of Global warming is deforestation. Animal
            consumes oxygen and produces Carbon Dioxide, while Plants do the opposite. Every year approximately 22
            billion tons of carbon dioxide is released in the atmosphere, of which 12 billion tons are removed by
            plants. Plant neutralizes the global warming. Thousands of trees are cut every year to clear places for new
            houses and building, for industrial uses and for domestic uses. This decreases the rate of oxygen formation,
            disturbs the natural habitat of wild animals. The amazon forest is the biggest forest on Earth, it is
            referred as the lungs of Earth. Global Warming is having a lot of disadvantages.As the temperature of Earth
            rises, the glacier starts to melt at the high mountainous range such as the Himalaya, Karakorum, Hindukush
            and Alps. </p>

    <span>There is only 5 percent of fresh water left in the world which is mostly stored in the form of glaciers. This
        causes a huge shortage of fresh water in the world and especially creating a huge problem for the future. As the
        glaciers starts to melts rapidly it causes flood, destroying thousands of agricultural fields and houses,
        killings thousands of lives and causing soil erosion. Soil erosion is resisted by plants roots, but as we are
        continuing deforestation, this would not be for a long time. All the water ends up in the sea. The melting of
        polar ice and glaciers causes a huge increase in the sea level. This is one of the biggest issues in the island
        countries such as Indonesia, Philippines, and Maldives. For example; the highest point of Maldives is 1.5
        meters, which is 8000 times less than the highest point of Pakistanâ€™s. Scientists have calculated that, if the
        sea level rises with the same rate right now, then there will not be any Maldives left in the map of Earth in
        2050. Apparently, they will have to see their home land sinking if front of their eyes, just because we were so
        selfish to burn unwanted fuels and wasting fresh water. Another big problem caused by Global Warming is habitat
        loss. The species found in a particular area are having adaptations according to the conditions found in that
        area. If the climate of an area is changing, then the routine of the organisms living in that area will be
        disturbed. For example, the hibernation of bears is disturbed in winter, the young ones cannot go to hibernation
        easily. If the parents will go to hibernation before the baby, then the baby bear will die because of starving.
        Some even wake up in the middle of winter. The deforestation in India is one of the major reasons for the
        extinction of Bengali Tigers, only 6 individuals are left on the entire planet.</span>

        <p>A lot of organizations and NGOs are working in this issue, including The United Nations Organization and WWF.
            They are putting all their efforts to introduce the means to stop Global Warming. Some of the most useful
            things we can do to reduce global warming are; reduce the use of fossil fuels in our daily life, using the
            three R principles and use renewable sources of energy. Carbon dioxide is produced, when a fossil fuel is
            burnt. All the vehicles consume petrol, diesel or CNG, which are all having a fossil fuel source. Instead of
            using fuel consuming vehicles, we should use hybrid or electric vehicles. Hybrid vehicles runs on
            electricity on average speed and consumes fuel only in very important situation and electric cars do not use
            fuel at all. For example; Tesla is an electric car brand of billionaire Alon Musk. It is currently the
            fastest accelerating car and one of the safest and luxurious.</p>

    </div>
    <span>. We should switch from fuel consuming appliances to electric appliances. Another way of reducing global
        warming is using the three R principles; Reduce, Reuse and Recycle. If we are buying anything extra, like food
        or petrol, which is having an international shortage. If we are wasting petrol using too much power then the car
        needs then we are wasting it. If we are buying too much food and we cannot eat all of it. It will be wasted.
        Petrol is only available for 4 more decades and there are third world countries where hundreds of children die
        from hunger every day. So, we can reduce the number of things we buy. We can reuse some of daily products. For
        example, our cloths, bottles and hard paper. Some materials can be recycled like; Paper, Rubber, glass and some
        plastics. Energy produced from the non-renewable source produces carbon dioxide. We should focus more on
        renewable sources such as Hydroelectricity, Wind Power and wind Solar Power. They produce electric without
        making any pollution. So, all that we should do is to use fewer fossil fuels, use electric appliances, use the
        three R principles and use renewable energy resources. We can do at least this much for ourselves and our fellow
        Earthlings.</span>
